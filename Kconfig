# Kconfig configuration for custom WS2812B driver
config WS2812B_STRIP
    bool "Custom WS2812B LED Strip Driver"
    depends on LED_STRIP && SPI
    help
      Enable custom WS2812B LED strip driver with SPI backend.
      This driver provides better control and flexibility compared
      to the generic worldsemi driver.

config WS2812B_STRIP_INIT_PRIORITY
    int "WS2812B driver initialization priority"
    default 90
    help
      Initialization priority for WS2812B LED strip driver.
      Must be higher than SPI driver priority.

config WS2812B_MAX_PIXELS
    int "Maximum number of pixels per strip"
    default 256
    range 1 1024
    help
      Maximum number of pixels that can be controlled by a single
      WS2812B strip instance. This affects memory allocation.

config WS2812B_SPI_FREQUENCY
    int "Default SPI frequency for WS2812B timing"
    default 4000000
    range 1000000 10000000
    help
      Default SPI frequency in Hz for WS2812B timing generation.
      4MHz typically works well for most WS2812B strips.

config WS2812B_RESET_DELAY
    int "Default reset delay in microseconds"
    default 50
    range 10 1000
    help
      Default reset delay in microseconds between LED updates.
